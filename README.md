## Why

Personally, I love to give feedback to the user during a web experience. A simple click in a button and a lot of stuff could happen in the page. So, why don't help/guide the user to understand what is happening in the UI to make the whole experience nicer?

- ‚òùÔ∏è Only one tag per component (usually a `button`).
- ‚ù§Ô∏è Pure CSS.

## How does it work?

All the components have two states: the _default_ and the _active_ state. The state toggle occurs based on a class `is-active`.
